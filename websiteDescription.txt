## 🌙 **LUMILAB WEBSITE DESIGN — VISUAL + TEXTUAL BREAKDOWN**

---

### **Page 1 — Hero / Home Section**

* **Background:** a looping *video background* featuring glowing textures, luminous ripples, or smooth motion that reflects “light” and “clarity.”
* **Foreground layout:** centered vertically.
* **Logo:** “**LUMILAB**” appears at the top left in bold, modern uppercase letters.
* **Navbar:** white transparent bar with links — *Home*, *How It Works*, *Shop*, *About Us*, *Contact*, *Log in*, and a purple “**Try LumiLab**” button on the right.
* **Main Headline (centered):**

  > “Your skin. Your light.”
* **Subtext (smaller, below headline):**

  > “Discover personalized skincare powered by modern science and everyday simplicity.”
* **Primary button below:** “**Get Started**” — rounded lavender/purple button.
* The overall mood is calm, glowing, and welcoming — a soft lavender gradient overlays the video for readability.

---

### **Page 2 — How It Works Section**

* **Header:** “**How LumiLab Works**” (bold, centered).
* **Layout:** three horizontal cards with icons or images above short titles and descriptions.
* **Card 1:**

  * Title: “**Discover your skin type.**”
  * Text: “Take our quick quiz to understand your skin better.”
* **Card 2:**

  * Title: “**Get your Lumi profile.**”
  * Text: “Receive personalized product suggestions tailored to your skin.”
* **Card 3:**

  * Title: “**Shop your routine.**”
  * Text: “Build a daily ritual that fits your glow.”
* **Background:** white with light lavender shapes behind the cards.
* Subtle rounded shadows give the cards a soft, modern 3D feel.

### **Page 3 — Shop Section**

* **Header:** “**Shop LumiLab**”
* **Subtext:** “Curated skincare designed to balance, hydrate, and brighten.”
* **Grid Layout:** three or four rectangular product cards arranged in neat columns.
* Each product card shows:

  * Product image (minimal bottle or cream jar on clean white background).
  * Product name and short tagline (e.g., “Lumi Serum – glow with intention”).
  * Rounded “**Add to Bag**” or “**View Product**” button in violet or blush tones.
* **Background:** soft beige or lavender gradient to distinguish from previous section.

### **Page 4 — Risk Profile Section**

*(Despite the name, this section in your design seems to be a skincare diagnostic or personalized routine test.)*

* **Header:** “**Your Skin Profile**”
* **Text under header:**

  > “Understand your skin’s needs and challenges — LumiLab helps you create a care routine backed by real insight.”
* Layout shows circular icons or illustrations representing different skin types (oily, dry, balanced, sensitive, etc.).
* **CTA button:** “**Take the Lumi Test**” — rounded, lavender gradient.
